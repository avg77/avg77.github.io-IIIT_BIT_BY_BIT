WOMEN EMPOWERMENT

> Women Empowerment in India is the most effective tool for development as these days women across the world are actively working as a leader and surpassing others in all the spheres of life.But in India, especially women in rural India are still facing problems.
They don’t have connectivity,liberty and capital to start something of their own.
We are trying to solve their problems by connecting them to rest of the world.
Majority of them don’t even have formal education.It is  a great help for them if they can form a Self Help Group. 

> Real world example with execution:
Basically we are trying to create something  like Just Dial, As Just Dial helps you to connect with the local vendors and business.
Our website works in same fashion. It will help them to connect with various NGOs working in their locality we rely on our strong network.It will help them to build enterprises with zero capital. People who are willing to help can donate in their cause.
